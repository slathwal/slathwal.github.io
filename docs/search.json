    "text": "Permutation is a technique in statistics that allows you to perform hypothesis testing using any measurement of interest. The steps are as follows:\nThe permuation algorithm is generic and can be used for any measurement. The idea is to compare an effect observed in the training data with a distribution generated by assuming that there is no effect in the data and calculate a p-value to determine the statistical significance of the effect. The permutation test does not involve making any assumptions about the distribution, and can therefore be used for quantities such as median and mode, for which no standard statistical tests exist.\nLet’s look at an example of how to perform permutation test."
