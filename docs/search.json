    "text": "Problem Statement\n\nTake two exactly equal Gaussian distributions.\nDraw 3, 6, 10, 25, 50, and 100 random samples from each distribution 1000 times.\nPerform a t-test to check whether the sample means are significantly different from each other, with a p-value threshold of 0.05.\nWill the % of times p-value is less than 0.05, i.e., you reject the null hypothesis that the samples come from the same distribution, change with the number of samples drawn? If yes, will it increase or decrease with increasing number of samples?\n\nMy initial instinct is to say, “The chance of concluding that the samples come from two different populations should decrease with increasing number of samples. After all, the more samples we have, the less the chance of making a mistake.”\nLet’s test our intuition.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nfrom functools import partial\n\n\n\nTake two exactly equal Gaussian distributions\n\nx = np.linspace(-10,10,100)\ny1 = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc = 0, scale = 2) # Normal distribution with mean=0, and standard deviation = 2\ny2 = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc = 0, scale = 2) # Second normal distribution with mean = 0, standard deviation = 2\n\n# Plot the two distributions\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, layout = \"constrained\", sharey=True)\nax1.plot(x, y1, label = \"Population 1\", c = \"blue\")\nax1.set_xlabel(\"\")\nax1.set_ylabel(\"Probability\")\nax1. set_title(\"Population 1\")\nax2.plot(x, y2, label = \"Population 2\", c = \"red\")\nax2.set_xlabel(\"\")\n#ax2.set_ylabel(\"Probability\")\nax2. set_title(\"Population 2\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw random samples and check if sample means are significantly different\n\nn_trials = 1000\nn_samples = np.array([3,6,10,25,50,100,150, 200,350, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750 ,2000])\nsignificance_threshold = 0.05\n\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed = 42)\n\ndef test_significant_difference(sample1, sample2):\n    tstatistic, pvalue = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2, equal_var = True)\n    return (tstatistic, pvalue)\n\ndef compare_two_randomly_drawn_samples(n_samples, significance_threshold):\n    sample1 = rng.normal(loc = 0, scale = 2, size = n_samples) # Draw random samples from 1st population\n    sample2 = rng.normal(loc = 0, scale = 2, size = n_samples) # Draw random samples from 2nd population\n    tstatistic, pvalue = test_significant_difference(sample1, sample2)\n    significance = False\n    if (pvalue &lt; significance_threshold):\n        significance = True\n    return (pvalue, significance, tstatistic)\n\ndef significant_results(n_samples, significance_threshold, n_trials):\n    pvalue_list = []\n    significance_list = []\n    tstatistic_list = []\n    for trial in range(n_trials):\n        pvalue, significance, tstatistic = compare_two_randomly_drawn_samples(n_samples, significance_threshold)\n        \n        pvalue_list.append(pvalue)\n        significance_list.append(significance)\n        tstatistic_list.append(tstatistic)\n\n\n    #fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout = \"constrained\")\n    #ax.hist(tstatistic_list, bins = 50, density = True)\n    #ax.axvline(x = 0.05, c= \"red\", ls = \"--\")\n    #ax.set_xlabel(\"p-value\")\n    #ax.set_xlabel(\"t-statistic\")\n    #ax.set_ylabel(\"Percentage of samples\")\n    #ax.set_title(f\"Number of samples: {n_samples}\")\n\n    return pvalue_list, significance_list\n    \n    \n    \n# Run the above for different sample sizes\n\npercentage_significant_list = []\nfor samples in n_samples:\n    #print(samples)\n    pvalue_list, significance_list = significant_results(samples,significance_threshold, n_trials)\n    percentage_significant_list.append(sum(significance_list)/len(significance_list)*100)\n    \nresults_df = pd.DataFrame({\"samples\": n_samples, \"percentage_significant\": percentage_significant_list})\nresults_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsamples\npercentage_significant\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n4.3\n\n\n1\n6\n5.4\n\n\n2\n10\n5.0\n\n\n3\n25\n4.7\n\n\n4\n50\n4.5\n\n\n5\n100\n5.3\n\n\n6\n150\n4.6\n\n\n7\n200\n5.0\n\n\n8\n350\n5.4\n\n\n9\n500\n7.0\n\n\n10\n750\n4.4\n\n\n11\n1000\n6.1\n\n\n12\n1250\n4.5\n\n\n13\n1500\n4.0\n\n\n14\n1750\n5.5\n\n\n15\n2000\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataframe tabulates the percentage of times we conclude that the samples are drawn from different populations for different number of samples drawn from the population.\n\n\nCompare the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis with increasing number of samples\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nresults_df.plot(x = \"samples\", y = \"percentage_significant\", style = \"o\", ax = ax, ylim = (0,10))\nax.axhline(y = 5, c = \"red\", ls = \"--\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Percentage of trials where we reject null hypothesis\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results show that our intuition is incorrect. As number of samples increase, the percentage of trials where we will conclude that samples come from two different populations stays constant at about 5%. This is because p-value actually defines the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis incorrectly. So, if we have a significance threshold of 0.05, there is a 5% chance that we will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. This chance remains the same, irrespective of the number of samples drawn.\n\n\nAnimate random sampling\nLet’s visualize one of the cases with an animation.\n\nn_trials = 100\nn_samples = 10\n\n# Generate the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(layout = \"constrained\")\nline1, = ax.plot(x, y1, c = \"blue\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Probability\")\nline2, = ax.plot(x, y2+0.001, c = \"red\")\n\nscat1 = ax.scatter(rng.normal(loc = 0, scale = 2, size = n_samples), 0.05*np.ones(n_samples), c = \"blue\", s = 100, alpha = 0.6, label = \"Sample 1\")\nscat2 = ax.scatter(rng.normal(loc = 0, scale = 2, size = n_samples), 0.05*np.ones(n_samples), c = \"red\", s = 100, alpha = 0.6, label = \"Sample 2\")\nax.set_xlim((-10, 10))\ntext = ax.text(x = 0, y = 0.06, s = \"\", horizontalalignment='center', verticalalignment='center')\nax.legend()\n\ndef update(frame):\n    tempx1 = rng.normal(loc = 0, scale = 1, size = n_samples)\n    tempy1 = 0.03*np.ones(n_samples)\n    data1 = np.stack([tempx1, tempy1], axis = 1)\n    scat1.set_offsets(data1)\n    tempx2 = rng.normal(loc = 0, scale = 1, size = n_samples)\n    tempy2 = 0.02*np.ones(n_samples)\n    data2 = np.stack([tempx2, tempy2], axis = 1)\n    scat2.set_offsets(data2)\n    _, pvalue = test_significant_difference(tempx1, tempx2)\n    color = \"red\" if (pvalue &lt; significance_threshold) else \"green\"\n    significance = \"No difference\" if (pvalue &gt;= significance_threshold) else \"Significant difference\"\n    text.set_text(f\"trial:{frame+1}\\n pvalue = {pvalue:.3f}\\n Conclusion:\\n{significance}\")\n    text.set_color(color)\n    return(scat1, scat2)\n\n# Construct FuncAnimation Object\nani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig = fig, func = update, frames = 100, interval = 1000)\nani.save('animation_drawing.gif', writer='pillow');\nplt.close()\nHTML(ani.to_jshtml())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n        \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n    \n    \n      \n      Once\n      \n      Loop\n      \n      Reflect\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Click the forward arrow button to play the animation.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Permutation is a technique in statistics that allows you to perform hypothesis testing using any measurement of interest. The steps are as follows:\nThe permuation algorithm is generic and can be used for any measurement. The idea is to compare an effect observed in the training data with a distribution generated by assuming that there is no effect in the data and calculate a p-value to determine the statistical significance of the effect. The permutation test does not involve making any assumptions about the distribution, and can therefore be used for quantities such as median and mode, for which no standard statistical tests exist.\nLet’s look at an example of how to perform permutation test."
