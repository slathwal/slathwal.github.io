The analysis of Canadian Community Health Survey data from 2019-20 revealed that the prevalence of diabetes is much higher in some Canadian regions than others. This led to the question:

**Is it possible to identify the most important factors associated with presence of diabetes from survey data (as broad as the Community Health Survey data)?**

To answer the above, I built a predictive machine learning model and identified the top 20 factors that are associated with the presence of diabetes. 

You can explore the code for the ML model on [github](https://github.com/slathwal/diabetes_canada_project). A brief blog post on exploratory analysis of the data is also availabel [here](https://slathwal.github.io/blogs/2025-05-13/). A detailed blog post on the ML model is coming soon.

## Analysis of clinical and molecular data for pancreatic cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

The PDAC-app is an interactive application that allows users to explore the pancreatic cancer data available from TCGA. 

You can look at the overall demographic distribution of the patients, Kaplan Meier survival plots broken by clinical characteristics, and an analysis of tumor purity and molecular clusters in the data based on the article [Integrated Genomics Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(17)30299-4?).

You can interact with the data in the [shiny app here](https://slathwal.shinyapps.io/pdac-app/).

{{< video https://youtu.be/CECasG7M3r8 title="Political Donations in India" aspect-ratio="16x9" >}}
This web application was created as the final project for Harvard's course, CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.
The following tools were used:

- Python for extracting the data from pdf to csv format
- R for data exploration and cleaning
- RShiny for data analysis and visualization.
- Bootstrap library for R (bslib) to design a multi-page Shiny app
